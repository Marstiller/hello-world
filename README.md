learning to use github

I've been self-studying Linux for many years and I'm trying to make a change of career into IT as a Linux System Administrator although I do not have a college degree. I am confident that given the chance, I can easily fill a system administator position. I am also starting to learn Python programming. I am currently learning about GetHub to show my scripting skills to propesctive employers as well as being able to network with others and have fun collaborating with others on projects.
